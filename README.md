[This project focusses on the future of AI gaming](https://www.deepmind.com/)

## Inspiration 🗼

1) [Unfortunately the creator didn't share the src code due to copyright reasons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXA7zXVz8A4&t=12s)
2) [Story of ALPHAGO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y)

## Versions 🗽

1) [GoAI V1.0.0](https://github.com/danonymous856/MINI_PROJECT-sem5-)
2) TBD

## Code Requirements 🦄
You can install Conda for python which resolves all the dependencies for machine learning.

`pip install requirements.txt`

## Description 🏎️
An autonomous car (also known as a driverless car, self-driving car, and robotic car) is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. Autonomous cars combine a variety of techniques to perceive their surroundings, including radar, laser light, GPS, odometry, and computer vision. Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage
